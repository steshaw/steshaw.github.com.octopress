Understanding me
----------------

Many years ago, I did the [Keirsey Temperament Sorter](http://keirsey.com/) personality test. There are two: a short one and a longer one. 

The result was [INTJ Mastermind/Scientist](http://www.personalitypage.com/INTJ.html) for both.

Later, I took a standard Myer-Briggs personality test which came up with [INTP Architect/Thinker](http://www.personalitypage.com/INTP.html). This is a typical profile for a computer programmer.
